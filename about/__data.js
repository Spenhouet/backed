For me, some form of\ndiversification into different asset classes seemed sensible. Also assets which are backed\nby another asset looked very interesting to me. Or even better, an asset backed by other\nassets of different asset classes. While researching this topic, I quickly noticed the lack\nof information on backed assets. This is why I created this open-source project which seeks\nto build up a knowledge base and a community around the topic of asset backing.\u003C\u002Fdd\u003E\u003Cdd class=\"mt-2 text-base text-gray-500\"\u003EIf you have any questions, want to contribute or any other request, feel free to \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FSpenhouet\u002Fbcked\u002Fdiscussions\"\u003Ewrite here\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fdd\u003E"},uses:{dependencies:a,params:a,parent:a,url:a}}]}}(void 0,"data"))
