What if fiat is inflating?\nWhat if the stock market is crashing? What if the housing bubble could burst at any time?\nWhat if your favorite crypto project is just hype without anything backing it up?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the wake of the 2022 recession, I asked myself these questions. For me, some form of\ndiversification into different asset classes seemed sensible. Also cryptocurrencies which are backed\nby another asset looked very interesting to me. Or even better, a cryptocurrency backed by other\nassets of different asset classes. While researching this topic, I quickly noticed the lack\nof information on backed cryptocurrencies. This is why I created this open-source project which seeks\nto build up a knowledge base and a community around the topic of cryptocurrency backing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any questions, want to contribute or any other request, feel free to write \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FSpenhouet\u002Fbcked\u002Fdiscussions\"\u003Eon GitHub\u003C\u002Fa\u003E or by email \u003Ca href=\"mailto:contact@bcked.com\"\u003Econtact@bcked.com\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n"],"uses":{}}]}
