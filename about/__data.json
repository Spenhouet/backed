For me, some form of diversification into different asset classes seemed sensible. Also cryptocurrencies which are backed by another asset looked very interesting to me. Or even better, a cryptocurrency backed by other assets of different asset classes. While researching this topic, I quickly noticed the lack of information on backed cryptocurrencies.
